        "   - It is a process in which we can fix or remove incorrect, inaccurate and incomplete data within a dataset. It is omportant beacuse it helps to maintain accuracy, high quality, consistent data, reduces error and saves the time.\n",

        "2. How would you sort the following dataset first by \"Department\" (A-Z) and then by \"Salary\" (Largest to\n",
        "Smallest)? Write a step-by-step approach.\n",
        "    - Firstly, convert the given data into a table using CTRL+T then press option icon showing with department heading then an option window will pop up then choose sort A to Z ooption and press ok then go to salary heading and follow same process and select largest to smallest and press ok then all the data will be sort as asked.\n",

        "    - TRIM - this function removes leading, trailing and excessive spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "      LEFT - this function extracts characters from the start.\n",

        "    each function.\n",
        "    - The TODAY function gives date value that contains a year, a month, a day whereas the NOW function gives date value that contains a year, a month, a day also contains hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.\n",
